# Business Exchange Standards Recommendations 
 
The review is grouped by the business exchange process and then by the recommended data elements because of the business exchange analysis.   
 
These business exchanges can be grouped by specific business events.  For example, the same standard can be used for a commercial invoice, travel voucher, or grants invoice.  
 
The new data elements and each business exchange process will have its own GitHub feedback page, which is where you can see the input posted during the public input period.  
 
Thank you to all who provides input on these business exchange standards. 
 

<p>            Note: We are not requesting feedback to the elements previously defined in the existing inventory of FM Standard Business Data Elements, DATA Act Information Model Schema or the Fiscal Service Data Registry as part of this public comment period.</p>
<h3 class="mt-0">Proposed Business Exchange Standards</h3>
<p> 
             When preparing feedback, consider the following:
        </p>
<p>
	<strong>For the Business Exchange Standards</strong>(the data that is required to be passed from the mission support system to the financial system and vice versa.) 
        
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
                If a data element has a condition that makes it not required, the data element is being proposed as optional.  If the data element is always required in the business exchange, it is proposed as required.   
            </li>
	<li>
                Are the data elements appropriately named?
            </li>
	<li>
                Are the data element definitions accurate?
            </li>
	<li>
            Are we missing any data elements?
            </li>
	<li>
                Is the data element required when the exchange of information is done?
            </li>
	<li>
               Is this list correct and comprehensive for the necessary information to be exchanged for the related business process?
            </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mt-0">Proposed Additions and Changes to Federal Financial Standard Data Elements </h3> 
   <p> 
             As a result of the business exchange analysis, there are also data elements that need to be added or modified in the Federal Financial Standard Data Elements for these business exchanges to properly perform the necessary exchange of data between systems.  
        </p>
        <p> 
             When preparing feedback, consider the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For the new standard data elements identified and defined: </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Are the data elements appropriately named?
            </li>
            <li>
                Are the data element definitions accurate?
            </li>
             <li>
               Is the Authoritative Reference(s) listed correct and comprehensive? 
            </li>
             <li>
               Are we missing any data elements
            </li>
              <p> 
         Note: We are not requesting feedback to the elements previously defined in the DATA Act Information Model Schema or the Fiscal Service Data Registry at this time. 
        </p>
        </ul>
